# N-Body simulation projects

This projects consists in an implementation of the **naive algorithm for the n-body problem simulation**.

For the **visualization of the particles**, I used the graphical library **SFML**.

I decided to use OOP offered by C++ to **encapsulate** the datas related to every particle of the simulation, inside instances of the `Particle` class.
